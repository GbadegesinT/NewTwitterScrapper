Twitter API Interaction with Tweepy
This repository provides a guide on how to interact with the Twitter API using Python and the Tweepy library. Recent changes to the Twitter API may have made existing libraries and scraping techniques obsolete. This guide aims to help you get started with the latest Twitter web scraping techniques using Tweepy.

Prerequisites
Before getting started, ensure that you have Python installed on your system.

Twitter API Access Levels
Please note that you cannot scrape tweets (Search Tweets) using the Free Level Access on the Twitter API. Free Level Access allows you to use the Manage Tweets and User Lookup features. To access the Search Tweets feature, you need to upgrade to the Basic Level.
